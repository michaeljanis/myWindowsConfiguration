How do I get set up?
Summary of set up

I use WSL to get a simple, consistent and powerful environment for Python coding - both locally and on the web I use GCP for web projects. I use bitbucket for code versioning and team sharing

Start with the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) install. It doesn't matter if you already have anaconda for windows, although I'd suggest uninstalling that at some point to avoid confusion.

Step 1: Install WSL and Linux (I recommend Ubuntu) https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-linux-subsystem-for-windows10/

Step 2: Install Anaconda (python3 please) and VS Code on Ubuntu Linux: https://gist.github.com/kauffmanes/5e74916617f9993bc3479f401dfec7da

Step 3: Install and configure a useful command line terminal for Linux and Anaconda: https://jackwarren.info/blog/cmder and install and use zhs (my .zshrc file is in this project).

Step 4: Configure VS Code for use in the WSL environment you've created https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl

Step 5: Work with windows files under WSL https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/07/22/fun-with-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/

Step 6: Install Jekyll for webpage creation

Step 7: Blastoff!
